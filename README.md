## Student GPA Counter

This project was one of the tasks during my time in college. In this project, I was required to use the C++ programming language and apply the concepts that had been taught throughout the course. The result is a simple console-based application that functions as a student GPA (IPK) calculator, allowing users to input course data and calculate a final GPA along with the corresponding letter grade and academic remark.
